# Real-time Audio Analysis using STM32

We perform simple real-time audio analysis by implementing FFTs and Convolution from scratch on STM32F407 Discovery board. 
The audio is captured through the on-board microphone and buffered to perform the following techniques: 
- Vowel analysis: Estimating formant frequencies and pitch.
- Real-time Spectrum Analyzer: Compute and display the real-time frequency response of the microphone audio and investigate windowing effects.
